# Lorentz-Transformation-Applet
I volunteered to make an applet that has 2 graphs. On one you can click stuff and on the other one the lorentz transformation of the point that you clicked is shown. You should be able to see the cosmic lines and hyperboles. I tried to do this in java for a start but java is really not plug & play with these and we need this to be short and sweet, so javascript.

I'll try to use CanvasJS and Jquery.

People i need to thank for helping me with learning Java, HTML and JS.
